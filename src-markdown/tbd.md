Here's an Anki card that explains the issue with the given code.

### Front:
Why is the following Java code producing incorrect results?

```java
double output = 0;
for (int d = 0; d < 8; d++) {
    output += (1 / 8) * recursivelySolve(n, k - 1, row + arrRows[d], col + arrCols[d]);
}
return output;
```

### Back:
The issue arises because the expression `(1 / 8)` performs **integer division** in Java, which results in `0` instead of the expected `0.125`. In integer division, dividing two integers yields an integer result by truncating the decimal part.

To fix this, at least one of the operands needs to be a double. You can change `1` to `1.0` or `8` to `8.0` to ensure floating-point division:

```java
output += (1.0 / 8) * recursivelySolve(n, k - 1, row + arrRows[d], col + arrCols[d]);
```

Now, the division will correctly return `0.125`.
