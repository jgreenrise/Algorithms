# Tower of Hanoi

## Question

Implement the Tower of Hanoi algorithm to solve the puzzle for a given number of disks. The Tower of Hanoi consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod.

## Answer

The Tower of Hanoi algorithm is implemented using recursion. Here's the Java code:

```java
private int towerOfHanoi(int n, String source, String auxillary, String destination) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Move n-1 disk from source to Aux, using Destination tower
    int countSteps = towerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, destination, auxillary);

    // Move from Source to destination
    countSteps++;

    // Move n-1 disks from AUX to Destination, using Source
    countSteps += towerOfHanoi(n - 1, auxillary, source, destination);

    return countSteps;
}
```

## Challenges

The Tower of Hanoi problem involves solving a classic recursive puzzle. Challenges may include understanding the recursive nature of the algorithm and optimizing it for larger inputs.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the number of disks. This is due to the recursive nature of the algorithm, which explores all possible moves.
